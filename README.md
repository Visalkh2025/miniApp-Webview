# Mini App Web Sample

Professional mini app demo for banking/native mobile integration using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This project demonstrates how a mini web application can communicate with a native banking application through a JavaScript bridge (`JBright`).

The sample includes:

* payment flow
* native callback handling
* permission access
* mobile-first UI
* dark mode support
* responsive banking-style UX

---

# JBright Concept

JBright is a JavaScript bridge layer between:

```text id="hf4q9k"
Mini Web App
        ↕
JBright Bridge
        ↕
Native Mobile Application
```

It allows web developers to build mini apps using standard web technologies while still being able to access native mobile capabilities through simple JavaScript APIs.

* Payment success / pending / failed screens
* Native callback simulation
* Device permission demo
* Camera permission
* Contacts permission

# Example Payment Request

```javascript id="ehvtot"
const paymentRequest = {

    merchantId: "CAFE001",
    amount: 5.50,
    currency: "USD",
    orderId: "ORDER001"

};

JBright.call(
    "banking.payment.initiate",
    paymentRequest
);
```

---

# Example Native Callback

```javascript id="kqb72x"
window.onPaymentResult({

    success: true,
    transactionId: "TXN999888",
    amount: 5.50,
    currency: "USD",
    message: "Payment Completed"

});
```

---

# Device Permission APIs

```javascript id="njm78x"
JBright.call("permission.camera");

JBright.call("permission.contacts");

JBright.call("permission.location");

JBright.call("permission.photos");
```

---

# Supported Native Features

JBright can communicate with native mobile capabilities such as:

* Payment
* Camera
* Contacts
* Location
* Photos & Files
* Biometrics
* QR Scanner
* Push Notifications
* Native Navigation

---

# Purpose

* Mobile Web UI

---

# Run Project

Open directly:

```text id="jnj76d"
index.html
```

Or use local server:

```bash id="upw2cm"
npx serve
```

---

# GitHub Pages Deployment

Enable GitHub Pages:

```text id="f3ap5i"
Settings
→ Pages
→ Deploy from branch
→ main
→ /root
```

Live URL example:

```text id="wfqt43"

# Example Use Cases

* Banking Mini Apps
* Merchant Checkout
* QR Payment
* Embedded WebView Apps
* Super App Ecosystem
* Payment Gateway Integration
* Loyalty Programs

---

# Notes

This project is a frontend demo and simulates native bridge communication.

Real production implementations should:

* validate native requests
* securely verify payment status
* encrypt sensitive data
* use production banking SDKs
* implement authentication & authorization
